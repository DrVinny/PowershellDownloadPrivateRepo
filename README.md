# Powershell Download Private Repo

## This script uses powershell to download a private repo from github.com, then saves it as a .zip file to $pwd

### Information required:
- Repo owner
- Repo name
- Access Token
And optionally,
- A branch name if you want to download a branch other than main

Note that public repos do not require an access token, so all you need to know is the owner and repo name
